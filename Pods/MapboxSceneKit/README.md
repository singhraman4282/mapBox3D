# Mapbox Scene Kit SDK for iOS

<img alt="Mapbox Scene Kit SDK" src="./docs/img/scenekit.jpg" width="272" align="right" />

Using Swift, bringing our rich 3D terrain into your iOS app is easy. SceneKit SDK benefits from Apple’s toolchain and tight integration with ARKit. Using Apple's built-in Scene Kit frameworks means you can leverage compelling virtual terrain experiences without bloating your app's size.

**Note this SDK is in its beta phase and will be under heavy development as we move towards our 1.0**

## Requirements

The Mapbox Scene Kit SDK are compatible with applications written in Swift 4 or Objective-C in Xcode 9.0, and require iOS 10 or above (the examples require iOS 11 or above).

## Installation

### Using CocoaPods

To install Mapbox Scene Kit using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/):

1. Create a [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html) with the following specification:
   ```ruby
   pod 'MapboxSceneKit', :git => 'https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-scenekit.git'
   ```

1. Run `pod repo update && pod install` and open the resulting Xcode workspace.

### Using Carthage

Alternatively, to install Mapbox SceneKit using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/):

1. Create a [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#github-repositories) with the following dependency:
   ```cartfile
   github "mapbox/mapbox-scenekit"
   ```

1. Run `carthage update --platform iOS` to build just the iOS dependencies.

1. Follow the rest of [Carthage’s iOS integration instructions](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos). Your application target’s Embedded Frameworks should include MapboxSceneKit.framework.

## Configuration

1. Mapbox APIs and vector tiles require a Mapbox account and API access token. In the project editor, select the application target, then go to the Info tab. Under the “Custom iOS Target Properties” section, set `MGLMapboxAccessToken` to your access token. You can obtain an access token from the [Mapbox account page](https://www.mapbox.com/account/access-tokens/).

## Examples

1. Clone the repository or download the [.zip file](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-scenekit/archive/master.zip)
1. Run `carthage update --platform ios` to build just the iOS dependencies.
1. Open `MapboxSceneKit.xcodeproj`.
1. Sign up or log in to your Mapbox account and grab a [Mapbox Access Token](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/).
1. Open the Info.plist for `Example` and paste your [Mapbox Access Token](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/) into `MGLMapboxAccessToken`. (Alternatively, if you plan to use this project as the basis for a public project on GitHub, place the access token in a plain text file named `.mapbox` or `mapbox` in your home directory instead of adding it to Info.plist.)
1. Build and run the `Examples` target.
